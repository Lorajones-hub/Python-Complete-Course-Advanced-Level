    "# GUIs frameworks in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "As a Python developer, sooner or later you'll want to write applications with graphical user interface (GUI). Luckily, there are lots of Python GUI options available for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a link to over 30 cross-platform GUI frameworks in Python: [GUI Programming in Python](https://wiki.python.org/moin/GuiProgramming). \n",
    "\n",
    "The most popular GUIs included in all three platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux) are and are Python 3- compatible are: tkinter, appJar, Qt, Gtk, and wxWidgets). \n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing a particular toolkit is completely up to you. But in this section we will be working with tkinter GUIs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a brief overview for each of the most commonly-used toolkits along with their features so you can compare yourself and decide the one that is right for you!.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. tkinter: \n",
    "\n",
    " - It is Python's standard GUI package. It is always available as it comes with Python when you install it.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " - The easiest one to get started with.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " - The most commonly used.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " - It comes with IDLE which is very useful for experimenting, editing, and debugging with Python.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " - Provides various controls, such as buttons, labels and text boxes used in a GUI application. These controls are usually called **widgets**.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "### 2. PyQt\n",
    "\n",
    "- Is a multi-licensed cross-platform GUI toolkit written in C++.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Has large library of tools and APTs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Can be used to develop GUIs for mobile apps.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Provide many widgets including labels, standard dialogs, toolbars, buttons, text boxes, calendar, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. wxPython\n",
    "\n",
    "- An open-source C++ Python GUI interface bundled with Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Based on wxWidgets GUI toolkit.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- It includes 2D path drawing API, dockable windows, text editing and word processing widgets, and support many file formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Has a wide range of various widgets, including buttons, check boxes, sliders, and list boxes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The top GUI interfaces along with their pros and cons can be found here: [Top 7 Python GUI frameworks](https://www.slant.co/topics/6620/~python-gui-frameworks-toolkitsn).\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you start working with any of these frameworks, you need to install them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### In this section we will use tkinter GUI interface to develop our graphical applications. \n",
